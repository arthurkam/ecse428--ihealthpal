            <p><b>Our Goal:</b></p>
            Our project will be an online platform that will allow people to track everything health-related.Personal and customizable 
            accounts will enable individual users to track things such as calories, nutritional information, water consumption,
            weight, exercise, and much more. Each person that opens an account will get their own profile.
            Once logged in, visuals will help monitor the various health and fitness indicators. Tools for controlling access to
            personal information will be available as well.</p>
